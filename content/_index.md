## Bio

> **TL;DR** --- **Computer Science Ph.D.** in 2023 and **Dipl. Ing.** in 2018.

I completed my *Ph.D. in Computer Science* at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) in March 2023,
advised by [Pierre Sutra](https://sites.google.com/site/0track/) and [Gaël Thomas](https://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~thomas_g/).  
My thesis was about **unlocking programming support for persistent memory** (e.g., Intel's Optane DC PMEM) **natively in Java**.

I prepared my thesis from 2018 to 2022, as a member of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://www.inf.telecom-sudparis.eu/pds/),
in the [CS Department](https://www.inf.telecom-sudparis.eu/) at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en).  
There, I broadly explored **theoretical and practical aspects** of **persistent memory programming**, but also specificities of **managed languages** and their **execution runtimes**.

<!--
I ended up designing and implementing novel persistent objects for Java, that efficiently access PMEM as off-heap memory, through Java's direct-access interface -- `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
Atop that, I built off-the-shelf container and collection types (akin to those in `java.util`)
-->

Before that, I was in 2018 a *Research Intern* at the [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/) for 6 months,
where I worked with [Alexey Gotsman](https://software.imdea.org/~gotsman/) on **WB-amcast -- a novel fault-tolerant genuine atomic multicast protocol**.

I earned my « *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* » (*M.S. Eng.*) from [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en) in 2018.
My major was *Parallel Systems and Distributed Computing* ([*ASR*](http://asr.telecom-sudparis.eu/)) and I graduated *first in my class*.

I did the rest of my undergrad studies in 2015-2018 at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en),
in 2013-2015 at the [Lycée Camille Guérin de Poitiers](https://lyc-camilleguerin.fr/) (*CPGE* -- *MPSI/MP\**).
I received my *Science « baccalauréat »* (*high-school grad.*) in 2013. I was a high-school student at the [Lycée Pilote Innovant et International](https://lp2i-poitiers.fr/).

# Besides Work or Research
----------------------------

I truly enjoy any kind of *problem solving*, *tinkering*, or *experimentation* activities.
Not necessarily related to computers, but really anything where I can also get creative and crafty.
*Cooking* comes up first in mind, but that also includes various *DIY projects*.
For instance, I designed and sew [my own custom frame bags](/pictures/bike-frame-bag-2020.jpg) to fit on my bike.

When I grow [tired of sitting at my desk](/pictures/batman.jpg), working on my computer, or just being indoors; I usually go outside and do [stupid things](https://www.strava.com/activities/7206716430):
- **Cycling**: (*Road*, *MTB*, *Touring & Bikepacking holidays*)
- **Running**: (*Road* & *Trail*)
- **Hiking**: (from *Day-Hikes*, to *Weeklong Alpine Backpacking trips*)
- **Skiing and Snowboarding**: (resort-only, for now)

I'm not doing any of those competitively; but just for leisure, on my own, or with friends.
At least once a day, to preserve my sanity.

Cities are boring, remote places are beautiful.

I might someday log here the routes and trips I liked doing the most --- you know, just for bragging purposes, 'cause ima show-off.

At some point, for some reason, I also learned how to ride weird **Freeline Skates** on [flats](https://youtu.be/jhnFwMh8EOQ) and [downhills](https://youtu.be/R5XPHowLpd0).

As a kid and teenager, I was also fond of **Gymnastics**, **Tennis** and **Judo**, which I practiced in sports clubs.  

I also played music for many years: **Percussion Instruments** (*drums*, *marimba*, *timpani*, and various other *orchestral percussions*).
